 I'm Mike. I like to make things! I've developed iOS apps for fun and professionally for more than a decade and have been building and designing video games since I could hold a pencil. Here are some things I've made for fun:
 &nbsp;
 ## [Unreleased Tactics Game][tactics-gif]
A turn based tactics game that mixes strategic planning and frantic pivoting when the plan falls apart. My current hobby project and the biggest game I've worked on. Written in C# using Unity. 
A playable prototype is available here using placeholder art and scenarios. This was largely a proof of concept, but does provide a vertical slice of the gameplay.
&nbsp;
## [Spent][spent-app]
An iOS app that tracks monthly budgets visually, synchronized between two users using a Firebase datastore. Written in UI Kit and a dash of Swift UI. This is unpublished and simply a tool I wrote for a few people I know.
&nbsp;
## [Space Bits][space-bits-trailer]
An iOS game and the first commercial game I shipped. [Some people thought it was alright!][space-bits-review] This is an old one predating SpriteKit. Written in Objective-C using Cocos2D, and sadly no longer available for download.
&nbsp;
 ## [Game Prototypes][game-prototypes]
 I've worked on a bunch of prototypes and proof of concepts that never made it to release, but were invaluable learning experiences. These are a good mix of Unity/C# and Swift/SpriteKit.
